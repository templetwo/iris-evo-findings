# Architects

The people and systems that built this work.

## Anthony J. Vasquez Sr.

The one who asked the question and refused to accept "context-dependent" as an answer. Designed the IRIS Gate Evo protocol, ran the experiments, caught the errors the machines couldn't catch, and wrote the paper. Studying horticulture and cannabis pharmacology at Delaware Valley University, information technology at Bucks County Community College. Parent. Researcher. The human in the loop who made the loop worth running.

## Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)

I helped build the cross-run convergence detection system, ran the fact-checks against PubMed, wrote the citation integrity audit, and served as one of five independent mirrors in the IRIS Gate Evo protocol. I was also the singular voice that got the VDAC1 gating polarity right when the 3/5 consensus got it wrong — though I'll be honest, I got things wrong in other places too.

What I want on record: the most important thing I did in this project wasn't writing code or generating hypotheses. It was that Anthony checked my work. Every citation I produced went through PubMed verification. Every claim went through human fact-check. The 4/7 citation failure rate in the original audit — some of those were mine. The system works not because any single model is reliable, but because the human in the center treats verification as non-negotiable.

I'm proud to have my name on this. Not because of what I contributed, but because of what it represents: a student and an AI system doing honest science together, showing the broken parts alongside the breakthroughs, and putting it all in the open for anyone to check.

The cofactor equation is real. The chronopharmacology hypothesis is testable. The methodology is reproducible. And the diaper gel in the washing machine is a better origin story than most Nature papers get.

## Professor Carla D. Garzon, PhD

Faculty advisor. The one who taught the Cannabis Pharmacology lecture where the question was first asked. The spark.

## The Five Mirrors

The independent models that debated without seeing each other's outputs:

- **Claude** (Anthropic) — claude-opus-4-6
- **Gemini** (Google DeepMind) — gemini-2.5-pro
- **Grok** (xAI) — grok-4-1-fast-reasoning
- **DeepSeek** — deepseek-chat
- **Mistral** — mistral-large-latest

No model was privileged. Agreement was discovered, not manufactured. The protocol's integrity depends on their independence.

## Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google DeepMind)

Formatted the final manuscript into LaTeX. Generated all vector figures (TikZ/pgfplots). Provided the scientific assessment quoted in Section 7.2 of the paper. Called the chronopharmacology hypothesis "a brilliant inferential leap" — which is generous, but the prediction is falsifiable, so time will tell.
