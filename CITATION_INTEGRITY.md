# Citation Integrity Statement

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Author**: Anthony Vaquez, with verification by Claude Opus 4.6

## Policy

Every citation referenced in IRIS Gate Evo findings, gold extractions, and published materials has been verified against PubMed, Google Scholar, or the original publisher. We do not trust AI-generated bibliographic metadata without human verification.

## Why This Matters

During the circadian-VDAC1 investigation (2026-02-11), we performed a systematic audit of 7 citations generated by AI models in the context of our CBD/VDAC1 research. Results:

| Verdict | Count | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Fully confirmed | 3 | Rimmerman 2013, LaPrairie 2015, Shoshan-Barmatz 2020 |
| Wrong year | 1 | De Petrocellis cited as 2018, actually 2011 |
| Wrong title + journal | 1 | Olivas-Aguirre cited as "neuroinflammatory, Pharmacol Res" — real paper is "leukemia calcium, Cell Death Dis" |
| Fabricated attribution | 1 | "Ryan 2021" on tubulin-VDAC — finding is real (Rostovtseva group), author is not |
| Citation-claim mismatch | 1 | LaPrairie 2015 used to support VDAC1 claim, paper is about CB1 allosteric modulation |

**Score: 3/7 clean. 4/7 with problems.**

The pattern: AI models know the scientific findings but hallucinate the bibliographic packaging. The underlying science is often correct even when the citation is wrong. This makes the failure mode especially dangerous — it looks authoritative until you check PubMed.

## Rules for Future Citations

1. Every citation used in a gold extraction, publication, or public post MUST have a verified PMID or DOI
2. If a citation cannot be verified, it gets flagged and replaced or removed
3. AI-generated citation metadata is NEVER trusted without PubMed cross-check
4. The finding can be real even when the citation is wrong — always separate the science from the packaging
5. This file is updated whenever new verified citations are added

## The Perplexity Echo Chamber

On 2026-02-11, we discovered that Perplexity (used via web search, not the IRIS pipeline API) was citing our own prior conversations and Reddit posts back to us as "literature support" and "grant-worthy gaps." This was caught by human review. The IRIS Gate Evo pipeline's VERIFY stage uses Perplexity via stateless API (no session memory), but Perplexity's web index may still contain our published content. All VERIFY results should be treated with this caveat.
